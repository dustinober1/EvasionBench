  truths:
    - Project onboarding and contribution flow are script-first by default.
    - Repository ownership boundaries between `src/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and legacy notebooks are explicit.
    - Notebook usage is framed as legacy/reference, not the primary execution path.
  artifacts:
    - README.md
    - CONTRIBUTING.md
    - docs/script_first_workflow.md
  key_links:
    - README quickstart points to script-first commands and workflow docs.
    - CONTRIBUTING enforces script-first rules aligned with CI and structure checks.

<objective>
Complete Phase 1 documentation baseline by codifying script-first conventions and ownership boundaries.

Purpose: Ensure repository structure direction is clear and enforceable for all contributors.
Output: Updated top-level docs and a dedicated script-first workflow runbook.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite quickstart to script-first defaults</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>Update quickstart and project overview so script-based commands are the default entrypoint for setup, quality checks, and run flows. Remove notebook-first onboarding language and explicitly mark notebooks as legacy/reference artifacts during migration.</action>
  <verify>README quickstart contains script-first setup and quality command sequence with no primary dependency on opening notebooks first.</verify>
  <done>A new contributor can complete setup and quality checks without using notebooks.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Formalize contribution boundaries and expectations</name>
  <files>CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>Expand contributing guidance to define where new logic belongs (`src/` + `scripts/`), what changes require tests, and how CI/local parity should be validated before PR submission.</action>
  <verify>CONTRIBUTING includes explicit boundaries and references concrete validation commands that exist in repository tooling.</verify>
  <done>Contribution rules directly reinforce script-first ownership and CI requirements.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add script-first workflow runbook and migration boundary notes</name>
  <files>docs/script_first_workflow.md</files>
  <action>Create a focused runbook showing canonical command flow (setup -> check -> run) plus policy for notebooks during migration (read-only reference, logic extraction expectations, no new production logic in notebooks).</action>
  <verify>Runbook includes executable command sequence and clear ownership/migration guidance consistent with README and CONTRIBUTING.</verify>
  <done>Repository boundaries are explicit, discoverable, and consistent across docs.</done>
</task>
