      "  question: My first question is regarding the user growth. First half, the user growth is very strong. May I know -- can you share with us the quality and retention and the user profile of the new user growth in first half and about the second half growth and also next year, what is the key focuses of your strategy of user growth? How are you going to balance the user retention and maintain the fast user growth in second half of next year?\n",
      "  answer: Last year, we have reinforced and reaffirmed user growth will be our key strategic focus and we have been carrying out the strategy efficiently going through the first half of this year, and have made very positive progress. As for the new user profile you asked, there is no significant change of the new user profile, we still see a lot of new young generations that are coming in. The average age of our new user is about 20 years old. However, we would like to emphasize during the user growth process, we're more focused on the quality over quantity, and the quality of our users can be supported by the daily time spend, daily time spend of 79 minutes per day. And our user engagement were up to 5.2 billion on a monthly basis, and our daily video views reached 1.2 billion. So, all of these numbers supported our users are not growing very -- not only growing very fast, their quality are very, very high. And notably, we've noticed that the new user who come in during the first half of 2020 and also paid for our services within the same period, the ratio has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. And also the new users who came on our platform during 2017, 2018 and 2019 who also stayed and paid for the next few years, their paying ratio is also increasing. So, once again, the -- this set of numbers is a strong testimony of the quality of our new user growth. So here we also wanted to emphasize the methodology of our user growth. The reason why we are very confident in the user growth trajectory is based on the concept that we have been really emphasizing that we use our content to attract user and use our community to retain users. And as you may notice in the first half of this year, we've done some significant progress to allow our content to reach a much broader audiences. And this type of user growth cannot be achieved by purely channel acquisition or user acquisition. If a user comes to our platform simply through the channel acquisition, we cannot retain them if there's no good content. And the key strategy is to allow our content to grow to a much broader category, and this opens up to new -- for us to new demographics. And Bilibili is a community with high engagement level and high retention level. Although our users increased significantly, our overall community maintains the same intensity and continues to be very sticky and with high retention rate. I'll update you the schedule of our user growth plan. So everybody know during Q1, the pandemic period, people have more time in their hands, so that gives us very good window to invest in user growth. And the second quarter, as people are going back to work and return to school, it came to a more stabilized period that we'll be focusing on raising our retention and converting those users to pay users. And notably, we've also made very good progress to raise our brand awareness in the second quarter and achieve pretty good results. And in the Q3 is traditionally strong peak season for us, so that we plan to make additional investment in both brand, as well as channel acquisition. I would also update you with our brand -- branding campaigns. In the second quarter, starting from May, we have made a very successful marketing campaign trilogy profits with Hou Lang, Ru Hai and Xi Xiang Feng, and we believe this series of campaigns as a complete marketing event, which we consider to be the most successful branding campaign among Chinese Internet companies during the second quarter. This proves our ability to not only to do amazing events among young generation, but we also have the ability to touch much wider, broader audiences. And the reason why we want to emphasize on branding campaign is based on our business model, we use content to attract user and community to retain user. As our content continues to evolve to reach broader audiences, one important step, too, is to allow more people to know that Bilibili have so much content to offer, which are in line with our new brand slogan Bilibili-All the Videos You Like. Okay. As far as our Q3 user outlook, we believe we'll reach historical highs during this quarter. And this summer is a little bit special because in July, a majority of the students are still in school, and August is a full month of summer vacation, and September will be the period where students are returning to school. So, in August, we believe we are able to achieve a pretty high MAU target, and on quarterly, monthly average basis we believe we can reach historical high. So, on a single month basis, we believe we can achieve over 200 million MAU target during Q3, on a single month basis. During our brand upgrade campaign this year, our overall brand exposure has achieved over 5 billion times. And the brand recognition level among -- just among the age brackets in between 17 to 35 has raised to 80% -- I'm sorry, 60%. And in the second half, our main focus will be on to convert people from recognizing Bilibili brand to turning to Bilibili users. And we -- during the second half, the marketing campaign were [Phonetic] surrounded our key activity around the key time slots, such as the summer vacation and returning to school, as well as the League of Legends World Championship and our New Year's Eve Gala and many work-like scenario among young generation and to create new content, new brand campaigns and further drive our user growth.\n",

    "**Question Statistics:**\n",
    "- Mean length: 62.3 words (SD: 33.8)\n",
    "- Median: 57 words\n",
    "- Range: 2 to 434 words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer Statistics:**\n",
    "- Mean length: 164.2 words (SD: 127.3)\n",
    "- Median: 133 words\n",
    "- Range: 2 to 1,432 words\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer Length by Category:**\n",
    "- Direct: 153.8 words (SD: 126.0)\n",
    "- Intermediate: 183.6 words (SD: 128.1) — longest on average\n",
    "- Fully Evasive: 79.2 words (SD: 73.0) — shortest on average\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Hypotheses Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hypothesis 1: Evasive answers are longer than direct answers**\n",
    "- **Result**: ❌ **REJECTED**\n",
    "- **Evidence**: \n",
    "  - Kruskal-Wallis test (all 3 groups): H = 796.74, p ≈ 9.76e-174 (highly significant)\n",
    "  - Mann-Whitney U (direct vs fully_evasive): p ≈ 3.28e-67 (highly significant)\n",
    "  - **Key Finding**: Fully evasive answers are significantly **SHORTER** (79.2 words) than direct answers (153.8 words)\n",
    "- **Insight**: Evasion in earnings calls is not achieved through verbose responses, but rather through brevity and circumlocution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Hypothesis 2: Questions receiving evasive answers differ in length**\n",
    "- **Result**: ✅ **SUPPORTED**\n",
    "- **Evidence**:\n",
    "  - Mann-Whitney U test: p ≈ 3.73e-16 (highly significant)\n",
    "  - Direct-answer questions: 58.1 words (mean)\n",
    "  - Evasive-answer questions: 47.9 words (mean)\n",
    "- **Insight**: Questions that elicit evasive responses tend to be shorter and more focused. Executives may evasively answer to-the-point, difficult questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Assessment\n",
    "- **UID Uniqueness**: ✅ All 16,726 UIDs unique (no duplicates)\n",
    "- **Empty Strings**: ✅ None (0 empty questions, 0 empty answers)\n",
    "- **Text Duplicates**:\n",
    "  - Duplicate questions: 97 (0.58%)\n",
    "  - Duplicate answers: 149 (0.89%)\n",
    "  - Duplicate Q-A pairs: 0 (0.00%) — excellent data integrity\n",
    "- **Outliers (IQR method)**:\n",
    "  - Question length outliers: 409 (2.45%)\n",
    "  - Answer length outliers: 697 (4.17%)\n",
    "  - These represent unusually long/short texts; worth investigating for quality or filtering strategies.\n",
    "- **Extreme Samples**:\n",
    "  - Shortest answer: 2 words (likely single-word or minimal response)\n",
    "  - Longest answer: 1,432 words\n",
    "  - Shortest question: 2 words\n",
    "  - Longest question: 434 words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "1. **Class Imbalance**: Apply class weighting, SMOTE, or stratified sampling during model training to prevent bias toward majority classes.\n",
    "2. **Answer Length as a Signal**: Evasiveness is *inversely* correlated with answer length — shorter answers may indicate evasion. Use text length as a feature.\n",
    "3. **Question Characteristics**: Questions receiving evasive answers are shorter. Consider question length as a feature or context signal.\n",
    "4. **Data Integrity**: Duplicate Q-A pairs are minimal; dataset is clean and suitable for downstream modeling.\n",
    "5. **Outlier Handling**: 2.45% (questions) and 4.17% (answers) are length outliers. Decide whether to filter or cap during feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- **Notebook 02**: Linguistic pattern analysis (readability, hedging, sentiment, topic modeling)\n",
    "- **Notebook 03**: Semantic analysis (embeddings, similarity metrics)\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: Traditional ML baselines (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)\n",
    "- **Notebook 05+**: Deep learning models, class imbalance strategies, explainability"
