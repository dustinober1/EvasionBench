5b0e9f26f7e9341d78857a4b61692331,"Thanks, guys. Lots of progress. Real exciting time. I know it's still recent from the release of the 413 data, and I know we still have to wait for the higher doses as well. But wondering if you've been able to do a little bit more work with kind of outside consultants and thought leaders about whether we could move forward with words-in-noise as a primary endpoint. Just kind of any conversations you've had any more confidence you got that, that could be the primary endpoint to complement the patient global impression. I think you still talk about making that a secondary endpoint. So I just wanted to understand any more progress there. And then as we wait for the higher doses and obviously, depending on that data, can you talk about the Phase 2b potentially being powered as registrational? I know you're still talking dose finding, but just wondering if that study could in fact depending on the data, be registrational. And then lastly, just ahead of 313, can you just remind us some of the steps that you've taken to try to minimize the placebo response as we wait for the August results?","Hi. Ken. Thank you very much for your questions. I think we have continued to talk about the WIN and shared those results with our KOLs as well as talk about the potential for that as a suitable primary endpoint. I think we continue to be very encouraged by data. What was obviously key for us in our data was seeing confirmation from both the Phase 1/2 and the Phase 2a study with the WIN response. As you may recall, it's very consistent between the two and clearly showed the WIN is doing a great job of picking up the benefit of OTO-413. So we do have conversations ongoing, but I think as we look at both the knowledge base of the WIN in the United States, audiologists are quite familiar with the WIN test. And the WIN test is one that has been heavily researched and validated in the hearing loss population. We do think it is a very good endpoint. And then obviously, it was part of our goal in looking at these three different tests was really to establish and identify which of these would probably be the most likely. So while we're at this point, still not confirming that, I think we do feel that the WIN is very encouraging and I can see that as a potential primary end point as we move forward, and that's something we're continuing to work on and talk about. So with regard to your second question and the dose finding and potential for registration, I mean, clearly, I think we have to recognize that this is a stepwise development. We're doing the first kind of research of its kind. We're the first to ever have demonstrated this kind of treatment benefit for a hearing loss population in two consecutive studies. And so I think we do have to expect that we're going to learn a lot more as well as, obviously, we'd be powering on very limited data. That said, I think it's important to understand, we always conduct our Phase 2 trials in a registration type format. We've done that with the 313 Phase 2 trial that we'll read out in August. And I think you can expect us to do the same with regards to the Phase 2b dose-ranging study for 413. We always feel it's best to run those trials very rigorously and to have them potentially prepared as registration if FDA is agreeable to the endpoints. So I think that's what you can expect for us here. And then finally, I think your last question was on the placebo response for 313. I think critically here, we saw a very low placebo response, as you may recall, in the Phase 1/2. And in fact, there was really only one patient that was showing that placebo response to at the lowest level. And I think part of that reason is because of this very strong requirement to have the clinical meaningful benefit be shown at both time points month one and two. And as well as the other parameters around the study that we have, including the TFI itself. So I think we do feel that it's important that we evaluate the placebo response, but we feel very good based on the Phase 1/2 I'm very encouraged by that. And I think that is one of the reasons you've seen us hold very strongly to that clinical trial design as well as the utilization of that responder analysis of both day 57 -- I'm sorry, at both month one and two in the case of 313. So again, we'll evaluate that, but I think we're very encouraged by that early data.",direct
e96dd4aafea4d393aaf036bbfee968b9,"Nice quarter. I wanted to get your updated thoughts on Arc and given the strength in that platform, if there's any new thoughts about continuing to be a JV or if it makes sense to be a separate entity at some point?",We have no current thoughts of changing that structure. I think that answers your question.,direct
9b6a5ffc7e4f3cd25ad3ffa82f037862,"Possibly, Allen, if you can remind us from the relapsed/refractory glioma phase 2, what were the immediate prior treatment regimen for those patients? Was it mostly radiation and also the temozolomide chemo? And the second is on ACTION, would have been better to have a physician's choice as a control arm rather than a placebo? Just any thoughts?","Yes. So in the first quarter, the choice of the control arm. And I think the -- I think it's important to note in the control in the phase 3 trial, post radiation therapy, there really is no standard of care. Patients typically receive the radiation therapy and then they wade wait into progressive disease. So this is an ideal time to study this. It also builds on some of the factors we saw in the phase 2 trial that we think will actually increase the probability of the success. Typically, this study, you're going to have a little smaller disease, you're going to be on therapy longer, and we're going to include the lower KPS score including the 60s. So we do think these factors increase our probability of technical success in this population. Yes, with regards to the prior therapies in that recurring experience, obviously, all of these patients had radiation recurred and weighted more than 90 days as I've noted on an earlier comment. In terms of additional therapies, these patients all prior to getting ONC201 tended particularly in the adult population to include temozolomide, even though that chemotherapy is known to not have a benefit within subsets of H3 K27M-mutant glioma. We still saw exposure to that just given the path of other agents. Other therapies included bevacizumab for symptomatic relief with edema in addition to [Inaudible], so really just a mixture of chemotherapy, and we're hopeful that moving earlier as we've noted a couple of times, moving earlier in line the therapy prior exposure to those chemotherapies will increase the likelihood of our patients benefit of ONC201.",direct
ecfd921bcef74828c756a7ffa10b57b0,"So in terms of the registrations or enrollment of Army personnel year-on-year, where do we stand? Are we down 20%, down 5% and where -- and when do we expect to kind of come back to last year's levels?","Yeah. So it's really -- Raj, it's really stabilized. In the third quarter actual, I think the Army was down for the quarter roughly 3%. And so, you're really seeing a return to kind of the prior year normal. Right now, as you look at our guidance for the fourth quarter, Army is going to be flat to slightly up, right. So it's really a combination of soldiers getting through that system, with the remainder utilize net ETP process that's really allowing them to now restart for those that were paused to restart their educational journey.",direct
50b9b2ffdf87bca1f85456cb248f1db4,"How many additional sales force do you expect to add to support the indication in the primary care setting? And second question is, when do you expect to see the full impact of the expansion of sales force to the community on the sales?","We expect to see the real impact of the expansion in the latter half of this year. This field force was obviously recruited in the first quarter. It's just getting up to speed as we move into the second quarter, and the full impact will be realized in the second half. But early signs are extremely encouraging, and we're really pleased with what we've seen. As regards to whether we need new and additional representatives to support the cap launch, the answer is simply no. We don't need to expand beyond where we plan to be, which would be at sort of steady-state, having about 40, 45 hospital-based representatives and about 40 in the community. And the reason for that simply is that many of the individuals that prescribe for skin also overlap significantly with those that prescribed the community-acquired pneumonia. And so you get a double hit on those individuals that you're targeting. You might shift your focus a little bit. Both of these diseases are a bit seasonal, as you can imagine, there's more skin infections in the summer and more pneumonia in the winter. So you might reverse your order of detailing, and you may over-index on certain positions for one indication rather than the other at some point in time. As we've stated in the past, we're very careful. We're putting lots and lots of representatives on the ground until we're sure that we'll realize the benefit. And if we feel that we can benefit from putting more in, we'll look at that at some time in the future. I think that the other component of the timing of how we've expanded the community, Suji, I think, is an important one to consider, which is that we believe that it was important always to have a solid foundation in the hospital setting to establish, I think, the credibility of the product in the sickest patients with infectious disease individual if physicians being the primary prescriber. The other, I think, feature of the predicate for setting the right conditions for a successful community expansion includes the robustness, we believe, of our market access efforts to date. And I do think that those efforts and our operational support here, I think we're part of the underlying reasons for -- despite insurance resets and some of the COVID pandemic headwinds, we were still able to see a robust quarter-over-quarter growth in the first quarter of this year.",direct

Kind of curious what that is?","Yes. Again, those are the investments that we have made in the past pertaining to a few investees. Again, those are the ones that we have made -- the investment we made with the intention of helping us in the targeted marketing area. We thought of the fact that we'll be able to have some synergy through these investees.
And the fact that now, we are winding down the targeted marketing business, so we deem there's no longer any value for them to keep on going forward. And the fact some of them are not performing well operationally, so based on the U.S. GAAP on the ground of conservatism, so we make a full provision for a couple of them.",direct
4ed3d61b5aaeedb608c34ba9aad83d71,Okay. And then kind of one question on for Karl on annual spend. The sequential decrease in Q1. Growth-wise still up sequentially on a dollar basis. But is this kind of typical seasonality we should expect?,Yes. Yes. So again Q1 is usually one of our lower one. In FY '19 we had a little bit of low performance in Q4. So some of that -- those Q1 deals may have been pulled into Q4 just as sort of the end of year processing cadence. But yes Q1 we usually have the same seasonality to our annual spend. So you can look back and use that as a good guide for the last couple of years as to how you should see it coming in.,direct
4cc2021ed42d9e0f568276fe4a2a499f,"Hey, Randy, in your prepared remarks you talked about having optimism on forward trends and credit quality for your markets. And I'm wondering what markets and/or data points you're using to kind of support your optimism?","Well, two things. I'll let Barry follow, but I mean our NPAs, we continue to improve with NPAs. A lot of these projects are being sold to developers who intend to develop those properties. I think that's very positive. They're buying at a very attractive price, but then most are -- they intend to make investments into, and I think that's a pretty good indicator. In addition, you've seen our delinquency percentages drop down quarter-over-quarter, so we're showing better performance than we did a year ago. And then when we look out at our customers and see the health of the balance sheet, you know, at this point, we're constantly looking to see if there are red flags. We just see a very good environment at this point. Barry, do you have anything to add. Yes, with across the markets, all the markets are still active. We have some good markets with some pretty strong growth. We're going to be coming into two new markets with -- in Utah and Nevada, which I think are going to bode well for us. So, we're staying on the positive side as far as market growth and respective production from those markets.",direct
cd24fab87971c312ae4c531b55c66083,"Good end to 2020. Just had one quick follow-up question on the sort of growth guide or I guess, two sort of follow-up questions there. What currency tailwind are you assuming in the revenue guide? And outside of the sort of faster growth in Advanced Surface Technologies that you described versus the business as a whole, are there any other material mix issues affecting sort of the margin outlook as you look in at 2021, the rest of 2021?","Justin, this is Milt. Let me take the first question on currency. When we provide guidance or outlook, and this is true throughout the year. We're always doing it with the perspective of kind of where we are currently at the time.

And so if you look at our biggest currency exposure, it would be the euro, and I think it was $1.20, $1.21 or so at the end of the year, and it stayed at about that level since the end of the year. And so our guidance is based on rates. So we're not -- we don't project what might happen to currency. So yes, the currency moves a good bit, either the dollar continues to weaken or if it reverses and strengthens that will have some impact on our guidance.

And we'll comment on that as the year progresses.

Yeah. I'll add a little color on the sort of mix piece and the cost piece. So Justin, as you know, we've been through a couple of these downturns before and have some history in terms of what typically happens, right? So coming out of these downturns, we typically get nice rebounds in all of the end markets that we serve. We're seeing that today.

Minus aerospace and oil and gas, everything else is really rock solid. But we also see commodity prices start to take off as well, right? So on the cost side, what we're managing right now is increases in steel pricing, increases in bronze pricing. We're pretty well positioned with PTFE, which is the largest commodity that we purchased. But some of the mix issues that we'll see this year that impacts our cost basis is, we do have a strong recovery in automotive, but we also have steel and Bronze powder increases that will impact our automotive businesses a little bit as well as the STEMCO business.

So we're real thoughtful in how we thought about the full year, taking those things into consideration. Obviously, we price and price aggressively. We put some good processes in place during the downturn to really link the supply chain group to commercial group a little bit tighter. So that we can pass on price increases immediately as we start to see them, and we've already started that process.

But I think it's mindful. We're mindful that we have to manage sort of an increasing cost exposure, particularly with our commodities.",direct
78c6f6cb12c5510ac1f343d66dd057fa,It's great to see some of the new products you launched gaining traction. Just wondering to the extent you can discuss any launches you're excited about for this year or particular segments where those new product launches are focused on?,"Sure. We have -- I'd say the areas that are generating the most interest here are in the Aerospace & Defense group and in our Refinery Valves group. So I mentioned the isolation valves that we've recently launched in Refinery Valves. Both of those products are very innovative, very different and solve big problems in the applications where we're selling them. So we're seeing a lot of interest in both products. We have orders for the delayed coker isolation valve of about $2.5 million in the fourth quarter, and so we're expecting that to ramp up as we progress into this year.

When I look at Aerospace & Defense, most of the innovation that we're doing there is in combination with our customers. So we'll win a program before the design is complete and design it with the customer. And we've got a number of interesting products that we're working on for Aerospace & Defense. One in particular is -- or actually there's several on these -- on the new nuclear submarine programs that are in development in both the UK and in the US that we're pretty excited about.",direct
c19d263b1c5018558270c8411f04d737,"Second question would actually be about your liquidity position. I know, Craig, you noted the -- I think in your prepared remarks you referenced is being strong. And you guys don't really have any near-term maturities, I guess, that would, you know, that would be concerning. You know, I guess I'm wondering, you know, how you think about that liquidity position. I mean, obviously, there's a fear out there, the economy is going to slow. The consumer slows down. Do you still feel like your liquidity position would be in a pretty good position even if we did go into some kind of, you know, larger type recession? And I guess maybe what might be helpful, you know, is to remind us how the business held up, you know, during the last recession or so, if that makes sense.","Sure. So, when I think about the liquidity position of the company, given that we have $176 million of cash, given that we're seeing substantial deposits and funnel payments for future travel, given that all the ships are back in the water and operating, I feel pretty good about where we are from a cash perspective today, assuming that current trends continue. So, that gives me confidence. I also have confidence when you look back to 2008 and 2009, you know, granted it's a very different time and things have changed dramatically since then. But even back then, at the height of the recession, the company's occupancy levels at the time were around 85%, and they dropped to somewhere around 75%. But the company remained profitable. The company didn't have to do a significant amount of discounting. And it discounted a little bit to keep occupancy levels high, but there wasn't a lot of that. And the company bounced back really quick. Within nine to 12 months, we were back to operating at full level. So, I feel pretty good about the fact that we'll be resilient in terms of -- if there was any kind of a recession. Obviously, our guests tend to be more affluent than most, and they tend to want to travel. Not to mention these are guests that have been, I would say, as I said in my comments, unable to travel for a couple of years. So, they really want to get out and explore now while they can. So, we feel like we have some really good dynamics that would help us during a recession. Certainly, we'll be impacted, but we feel like we'd be in good position to continue to succeed.",direct

The junior party holds the burden of proof for the proceedings. And so, they have to go first in terms of putting forth their depositions and their data.

I'm curious as you've recently updated the label both for the black box warning and the mechanism of action, if there's any feedback you can highlight from the field in terms of the response you're getting as you promote to most with those updates.","Yeah, sure. Hi, Corinne. So we're in the process of, you know, updating all of our promotional assets to reflect the boxed warning, as well as the mechanism of action. But I can tell you that already we're hearing that the fact that the boxed warning has been removed is news, good news. That's getting our field in the door. And the mechanism of action update has enabled us now to explicitly state, as Chhaya mentioned, TYMLOS is an anabolic agent that helps form new bone. That message is pretty powerful and simple.

That will be the largest single variable probably for the rest of the year on gross margins. That's why I think -- Jayson, Brian's script was saying, we feel OK about the 38% to 39% for the year.

01d7b0606f49c6c773b9668182a3a081,"OK. And I think you all did better than your guidance in the third quarter in SAO on margins, at least relative to what we were thinking. But PEP was a little bit late, maybe by a couple of million dollars if you exclude the insurance gain. So what missed perhaps relative to your expectations there?","Yes, you're right. So that was a couple million dollars. So in the whole scheme of things, not that large compared -- you had almost $80 million in two segments combined. But I guess the positive to that is that I think it's very specific to our Amega West business primarily. It's not a market issue. It's a specific new tool that we've developed and the adoption of that tool has not been what we would like it to be. So that's one specific, we had great expectations for that and we've fallen flat and we need to make that correction. But it's not a market issue. And if you look at the other businesses inside of PEP, Dynamet quite frankly is doing very well. They did a great job recovering from the fire that we had. Did our best to take care of all of our customers, and I'm very proud of how they've done that. And now we're investing money in both of our Dynamet locations to increase capacity because of the share gains that we've added, particularly on the medical side. So PEP is a pretty strong business for us, and we need to get after on the Amega West side those specific tools that we take to market and make sure we have the appropriate marketing plan to take advantage of their capabilities.

f0b715ff7fde7c0c3ff653570925dec1,"Yes. And then last question, it's a cyclical question. I think your Non-Medical is a cyclical business. I think we are entering into a period of time where I think we're not just early cycle, people are talking about, maybe we're getting early to mid-cycle on that, and you guys are just bottoming at $7.5 million. How should we be thinking about that business here?","So you're referring to our Electrochem, Non-Medical...

Sure, sure. We think this is definitely the bottom. We have seen an improvement in orders and demand from customers. We don't think that's going to meaningfully change our outlook for the rest of the year. We -- 2020, we were about $35 million in sales. We expect this year to be about the same as that, maybe a little higher, maybe a few million higher. So if you look at the first quarter at $7.5 million, that's a $30 million run rate. So it has to pick up a little bit to get to that $35 million to $38 million number that we're assuming for the year. Our assumption is that the oil and gas market doesn't really fully recover until 2022.

That's what we're hearing from customers publicly, privately. That's the baseline that folks seem to be operating with. And so maybe we're being conservative by assuming not much change from 2020, $35 million, but that's our baseline assumption. If it gets better, you'll see it flow through into our guidance over the rest of the year. But we're assuming very little growth on a year-over-year basis with 2022 being the year that we see the meaningful recovery.",direct

It's baked in. I think given the marketplace, we expect it to be promotional. I don't -- I wouldn't necessarily comment that it will be more promotional than last year. Certainly it feels like we've started a little bit earlier, but our direction has been to really reinforce our assortment to stay as far away from a lot of those promotional categories as possible, and really create a strong desirability for our apparel business. That should not have to be tied to a promotional mechanism. We will certainly have promotions, but our expectation based off the assortment that we have is that it will be scarcer than what's out in the marketplace and readily available. We will not be promoted as hard as the rest of the marketplace, and we'll tie back to our really, really strong sneaker business.

What we have seen is that bond capital is getting harder and harder to find.

I mean, it's funny, we don't feel like we've been quiet. But you're right, we haven't acquired any more ships since February in the last few months.

As I said in our -- in the prepared remarks, we think that asset values are trailing based on the current market. And really the most important thing for that is the forward curve, which continues to push up. Next year is now trading close to 15 and 2023 is moving up to mid 12. So, as people get more confidence in the forward market, we think asset values have potentially considerable upside.

So we are looking as we always do, we're looking at further acquisitions. We feel comfortable where we are with our 52 ships. We only have three ships remaining that over 15 years old. Ultimately, those are sales candidates as the other older ships have been.

But really in our mind, it's about obtaining fair value based on where we think, the cash flow generation is for those ships in the forward curve. So we're not there yet. But ultimately those ships likely will be monetized and very likely will continue to require ships on a targeted basis.",direct
1f0ca89c575001d6fdcbd7ffafc90824,What are the factors that have historically prevented sponsors from moving a larger percentage of their trials to a more virtual model? Are regulators on board with the shift to more virtual trials?,"Factors preventing more virtual trials include industry conservatism, regulators not being fully on board previously, and lack of precedent for getting drugs approved based on virtual trials. However, during the pandemic regulators have been more accommodating of remote approaches. We've seen a major shift, with pre-pandemic only 5% of monitoring visits being virtual, rising to 60% at the pandemic peak, and now stabilizing around 30%. Technology improvements are enabling more efficient remote monitoring. While we won't go back to pre-pandemic levels, the move to more virtual/decentralized trials will be a gradual process as the industry adapts.",direct
dc51b30431b87e5887e2345453f9d177,"Hey. I figured why not? Does it get easier to hire agents if the market slows? Just philosophically, maybe talk about that. Thanks.","Yes. No. It absolutely does. It's one of the benefits of a slowing market. When things are incredibly busy, agents don't have the time to have a conversation. They're too busy with their clients, which, of course, is their priority. So they don't have time to learn about Compass and to see what we can provide with our platform. And so that's definitely one of the benefits. And it's also worth noting, though, that we've seen extraordinary levels of retention. One thing we did not mention in the call is that retention in the last 2 quarters was the highest it has been in the past two years. And so we hear a strong indication that agents are seeing value from the platform, and they continue to want to -- they continue to see that this is a place where they can best grow their business, save time and best serve their clients.",direct
2546bb60829a021f414636b669aedefd,"Just some questions, the performance fees that you booked in Q1, it looks like that came from Lending Fund I. Just wanted to see if you can confirm that. And if there's -- that's all the performance fees you expect to collect? Or would we see some come up in future quarters?","Geoff, it's Kevin here. I'll take the first half of that around the components, and then I'll turn it over to Peter to speak on the outlook going forward. But yes, you are correct. The lion's share of that carrying performance is the carry from, from LF1. But then, to a lesser extent, there's some performance fees coming from some of the managed equities products we have as well that round out that total that you saw there. In terms of the outlook, it's always really hard to tell. LF1 needs to finish wrapping up. So I think there might be some further flow from that fund. Really, LF2 is much bigger and has had very strong performance the way we see it right now. But it's too early to forecast exactly when those performance fees will kind of be harvested. So it looks like it's a slowly ramping business, and it might be quite lumpy in terms of performance fees.",direct

I recall speaking about this a couple of quarters ago, at which point you thought that maybe in the construction season spring to summer 3Q '21 you'd be getting back to kind of mid-teens revenue, I want to recheck where you're thinking today about the cadence of your cable business through '21.","I think we probably can be significantly higher than that level later on in the year. We're sitting right now on the strongest backlog of cable TV products I think we've ever had. And as I've noted in our prepared remarks, this was the best -- the fourth quarter was the best quarter in cable that we've had in several years. So where we're standing right now I think I see pretty strong performance in the cable segment through -- certainly through Q3 and probably through the end of the year.",direct
669629fcce381d6878a6015464f3b5a9,"Okay. That's -- I get that. And last question on assuming that as we get out to next quarter, you guys are thinking about FY'22 guidance. Just what are some of the moving pieces you like us to consider at this point?","So, we will come out with guidance when appropriate, hopefully that will be at the time that you normally see. And we're going to keep our eye on COVID and the continuing impact that we see there. I think a lot of the things that we've been talking to you throughout FY '21 are going to be the moving pieces. I think first and foremost, we've got a line of sight to top line growth through our growth platforms in Auryon, AngioVac and what you're seeing clearly in the U.S. in terms of nano probes. That focus of course will continue as we head into FY'22. We've talked about our plans on continuing to invest in R&D, as well as continuing to invest in the sales force to drive that top line growth, and we're going to look to be as transparent as we can about those investments. But I think the expectation is we will be investing to support that top line growth that we think is going to be important to our long-term strategy. And then beyond that is the gross margin, which is what we've talked a little bit about this quarter in terms of our expectations. Again, the big point being we expect our margin profile to be positively impacted by our growth platforms over time. As we sit here today, a large part of our revenue base is coming from those more mature businesses and we've got one plant, it's in upstate New York, it's in an area where there is a tough job market in the sense that there aren't too many openings and a lot of people are hiring. And so some of the things, some of the headwinds that we're facing currently. But I think those are the major drivers that you should expect very similar to what we saw in '21 as you head into '22.",direct

Yes, it's my understanding you have received approval to report regulatory assets in just about all of your service territory. So the decision not to record any regulatory asset at this point based on COVID-19, was your decision driven by the fact that you were able to control your expenses at this point that they were reduced enough that you didn't feel a need to record any Reg assets? Is that a fair assessment of that?","Yeah. It's pretty close. I mean, as you mentioned, Charles, we've got the orders that cover about 90% of our customer base right now. We're evaluating the language in those orders. They were sufficiently broad and so we're interpreting how best to evaluate that order vis-a-vis our filings, talking with our regulators and we anticipate by the end of the fiscal year that we will establish some form of regulatory asset. It's just a matter of timing in this fiscal year when we establish that, but we are closely evaluating that right now and that's been factored into the guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year.",direct
57d956f6024e1e9c79fec4904030a1ae,"All right. Thanks. Just a couple more for me, guys. One being TRS rental revenue growth, nice acceleration in fourth quarter. Could you speak a little bit to the end market dynamics a little bit more and discussion of 5G considerations? Thanks.","Sure. 5G is -- we all hear in the news, it's -- different carriers are announcing different programs with 5G. It really hasn't made it onto the towers yet. Most of the 5G work is through backhaul and bandwidth expansions up through the networks and into the towers, but not so much tower work at this point. That 5G bandwidth expansion work, we're actually -- we're capturing work from that. And so that's helped with our communications rentals. And also over on the GP side, robust demand in aerospace and defense, and semiconductor industries has also helped us there. And we're experiencing healthy growth. Utilization for our GP equipment recently was at 75%, which is really healthy for us, and we're actively buying equipment to meet demand. And it's going out on rent. And Scott, I would add, if you look at the 8% growth in rental revenues, as I remarked in my comments, that's comprised of 9% growth on the general purpose side, 4% growth on the communications side. A portion of that 9% growth on the general-purpose side, we believe, is tied to R&D work related to device design for 5G. So it's not so much in the network build-out, but it's more devices and equipment that are being designed and need use of general-purpose equipment. So we are seeing that as a positive in that part of the business.",direct
667193be38e9f2d1cfe6148ec125e173,"On the obviously, pandemic, with the vaccine rollout under way and restrictions being increasingly lifted, etc, we probably should expect especially product business to bounce back, if not interchange, stop growing year-over-year. But on Human Nutrition side, I was just curious on, especially on the foodservice market, a lot of restaurants,etc., also likely starting to see improved business, is any of that showing up for you yet? Or is it still way too early?","Yeah, it is Mitra. We are -- we've talked about, we have approximately $50 million to $60 million of sales, or we did at least in 2019 that went into foodservice that really was a significantly impacted, and we are absolutely seeing an increase in that business. It's still volatile, it's still not consistent. But we are seeing that business come back in an encouraging way.

We have all along had as part of our Human Nutrition & Health business and really across Balchem as a whole parts of the company that were negatively impacted by COVID and parts that were positively impacted by COVID, we'll talked about Keurig Dr Pepper, and the business that we have with them likely there being a work-from-home, a boost to that business, that helps us offset some of that decline that we saw in foodservice and, and by and large those parts that have been somewhat benefited by the pandemic, we're seeing continue at very strong levels, and there are reasons to think that that will continue.

I personally feel as though on the on the supplement side of things that the strength and awareness that has been built over the last year will largely continue and so we're expecting continued strength in that business and encourage Dr Pepper just issued their results and I think they're very bullish about the year as well. And I think there's some staying power for that business. But there is as we see food service comeback more over the course of the year, there is some positive offset to any decline that we might happen to see from those other areas.

01bf91c40d7c5934c1c3dfb43c90c728,"The holdover inventory from holiday that you mentioned, was that originally aimed at full price? Or was it originally aimed at outlet?","Yes. The pack and hold was originally aimed at full price. And just to be very clear, the product that we packed and held is products that we brought in with extended selling life associated with it, but the product got delayed. So as an example, if we bought a dress and we were planning on selling it for 12 weeks in stores, it only came in and allowed us for four weeks of sale in store.

We packed and held full-size runs of that product, and there had to be two things that were true in order to pack and hold the product. Number one, it had to have a high sell-through for the products that did get out to the stores on the website; and number two, it had to fit into the assortment architecture or EFO next year. And we are very clear with the teams on both of those, and that's why we have high confidence we'll be able to sell that at full price next year.",direct

Maybe it'd be helpful to just kind of review when does that higher price roll through your P&L or how are you able to realize pricing in such a difficult operating environment.","Yeah. A couple of things, John. One, we normally have about six months of inventory in our kettle. So -- and we had -- we were probably at a relative high inventory level as we came into the last fiscal year. So as we're now in the part of the year where those zinc costs are increasing every month, rising toward current LME, so yes, that will just continue every month.

What does it say about your cost latitude and flexibility? Especially, if for instance, let's say, things turn around here again, how are you thinking about the cost levers that you guys spoke about just a few months ago at this point and ability to use them again?","Yeah. Good morning, Julien, thanks for the question. I'd say we're very well prepared going into the second half of the year. The employees have done an amazing job of identifying a lot of different opportunities to reduce cost for our customers, a majority of which are sustainable, others are temporary in nature.

Could you comment on that?","Oh, no, not at all. We've continued to invest in our marketing activities. The one area that we've been not pulled back on that have been forced to reduce is areas of our marketing tool box that require physical impact, for example, sampling, our sampling programs, which are highly people intensive.

I think it's a couple things, Budd. It's productivity -- it's not real big node closures. It's really productivity and cost savings net of investments and I think second quarter is a little higher on the investment load than the rest of the year.

c5c779c6b8079f3c49b7885ffec9f16d,"Okay. That's in the Utility market. And quick question regarding the tempo of the billings in aerospace and defense. Is that second half in A&D followed at 40%, 60% model or is it tilted more one way or the other?","Well, I think if you look at the A&D market, you're going to see a little more tilting to the back-end, because again, if I just focus on the large programs in that group, large meaning getting an order over $10 million, it's primarily around the submarines and the Space business. So we're in negotiations on the next pool, if you will, of Block V. And so we would expect not many orders on Block V in Q1 and Q2, because again, we got $100 million last year. So we should pick up another lot on the back-end of this year. And then within the Space program, at Boeing, the space launch system, the Artemis program, SLS, we're in negotiations as we have been. If you get that, it just -- it's a cadence of when they release the core stage numbers. And I think that should give us a nice book-to-bill in the back half of the year.

So we're burning off backlog in the first half on the large programs, we'll replenish that. And my guess or prediction for the order -- book-to-bill for the year will be fight to a tie, which to me is a home run, when you're burning off $100 million of running start from last year. So it looks pretty -- the profile looks pretty good. And that's why I wanted to emphasize the cadence of this. The book-to-bill is important, but it's really the sustaining of the backlog number as it burns off and it gets replenished in different quarters. So it's really just a mathematical kind of rejiggering of the quarterly profile, but the year looks great.",direct
c3ad49b3920bee51acbf4cef75b527b3,"Switching gears and thinking about new business. I saw in the earnings release, there was commentary, new business premiums were down. And in some ways, it reflected increased competition with fewer policies at adequate pricing levels. At the same time, it feels like we're in this firming or firm or hard market, however you want to put the terminology around it. But your renewal pricing is up mid-single digits. How do we reconcile this firming market that we're in versus the adequate pricing levels maybe not being where they need to be in some lines?","Hi, Phil, Steve Spray here. I would answer that with the fact that just we're in -- our industry is in such a dynamic environment. And some of the classes of business or segments that you see that hit the headlines as far as the highest -- the firming market or hardening market would be maybe in larger D&O policies, larger excess casualty policies, commercial property that would be catastrophe-exposed or cat-exposed coastal, those are certainly hardening. And it just varies across industry segment and class. When you get into more, I'll call it, Main Street business, we're looking at every single risk on a case-by-case basis. We're trying to determine an adequate price for that business. And I'd say our field underwriters, our agents are working through each of those accounts, again, risk by risk and just doing a great job. We've continued to see the metrics of our pricing on new business, and renewals improve throughout the year. So I think that's part of it. Another part of it that I would say that we've gotten a lot of feedback from agencies and talked to enough of them that one of the phenomenons in the pandemic was just that fewer policyholders were going to market with their insurance. And it typically was around -- let's say, there was no pain with the incumbent carrier. They weren't getting a large rate increase. They didn't have prior loss ratio problems or challenges. And so they might just be sitting tight for the year. They've got other things to concern themselves with. So again, it really gets back to adequate pricing.",direct

I know the backlog pricing continued to move up over the last several months as rebar prices escalated and a lot of that tends to lag as we know. So how many quarters do we have looking ahead where pricing could actually continue to move up or have we leveled out here?,"Yeah. Phil, I'll start. Barbara can add. If we look at our current activity that Barbara alluded to, it is strong in the fourth quarter.
And really, we continue to see good levels on the downstream work. And as a result, really, the backlog is made up of what's in there and new stuff.

They're good businesses, and they're sought after assets. So I mean, I'll let Warren comment on, as he said, he didn't really want to comment anymore on it. But everyone should just remember that we have great businesses and that are valuable. Yes. I think the answer to that question is that certainly, it's a difficult time even where the debt markets are at, and we've had to be creative in the way that we're talking to people and we're trying to evaluate opportunities. But I think the overriding point is that in spite of that and in spite of where the debt markets are at today that we have had what we would consider to be a good success and continuing on with this process. So to answer your question, it is still ongoing. And we expect that it will continue on with that process in spite of what's going on in the markets today at this point.",direct

Just as COVID kind of cases drop-off in certain regions, are you seeing a reversal in any of the market dynamics that happened during the pandemic? Like maybe cases moving back away from sort of the OBL environments? And then last quarter, I think you also said inventory in the field is as lean as it's ever been, which is kind of helping manage manufacturing operations in a more specific manner. Is that -- are you still seeing that the last few months? Has that kind of gone back to sort of pre-COVID dynamics at all? Just anything you're seeing there?","Thanks, Ian, for the question. Regarding the inventory management, what we had done during COVID-19 was to build up our inventory, really so that we would have a safety stock and protect against the possibility that we may have an outbreak in one of our manufacturing facilities. And as we build up that inventory stock, ultimately, that served as a good safety outlet for the company. As we moved into fourth quarter, we felt that we no longer needed to retain that inventory. And as a result, we slowed our production and basically flowed more of that inventory into the market, to really balance out our factories and get our inventory situation back in line with our normal expectations. So, that is really what our commentary has been as it relates to the adjustment since the COVID crisis.

Now in regards to the site of service, we really have not seen much change. Patients choose to be treated in office-based labs for a number of reasons. I mean they -- it is obviously more preferred by patients, they are not having to go into the hospital and physicians prefer it as well. So we expect to see this migration to the office-based lab continue, not unlike what you've seen perhaps in other medical technology markets that have the same characteristic. So really, post-COVID-19, there has not been much change. We see about an equal ratio of our patients being cared for in the hospital versus those in the OBL segment.",direct

I think when you look at the overall marketplace, probably the least penetrated vertical and actually the biggest opportunity for the industry, frankly, is education. Because if you look at in general, Hamzah, education has outsourced books, books and food service to secondary or outsourced suppliers. They haven't made the move yet in landscaping. Some data, the internal data we generated says as few as 20% of the landscaping has been outsourced by indication and still done mostly by self-perform crews. So in that vertical, we believe there is real good opportunity for us to provide, frankly, a better experience and a better performance of property, duty and health and actually while achieving some cost advantages in that segment. And we see results of that in our new wins for every month. We're seeing secondary as well as college and postsecondary schools are converting their in-house landscaping into brand new service contracts.

Can you comment more specifically on, what has been realized or what are we seeing in the numbers so far and what do you think you'll, that we'll see in the numbers in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2021 of that total realized gain?","Well, the -- total target within the $25 million to $26 million range, Brian. And our estimates for this year range from $10 million to $16 million depending on whether you're talking calendar or fiscal period. You can see or I will inform you that the sequential step up from our Q4 period ended March 31, to our Q1 period ended June 30, as stepped up by $4 million. So, there is a little bit higher volume in that timeframe, but it also reflects some of those synergies are taking hold. So, if you were to put it in a range, that range right now is in the $10 million to $16 million. So if I drew it at line and said it's somewhere $13 million to $14 million for this year with the other half going into next year.

And one of the opportunities we have because, we assumed we would lose some existing customers and we deflated our total estimate with the assumption that we would have some lost sales and we really haven't seen that yet.

And also it will be helpful if you can share with us TTP's operating metrics such as transactional volume, market share and their trends. And lastly, can you comment on how the consolidation of TTP could potentially impact the revenue and profitability in 2021?","Thank you for the question. I would like to join Mr. Zou to answer this question, especially, related to the integration and the planning of the used car platform business. After we control the shares of our TTP we actually continued our Autohome used car strategy. To summarize, that is light asset model and make it as a platform. We used double cloud to serve our customers. We also want to connect the full value chain. And we want to create a closed loop of the C2B and B2C. So we are dedicated to bring this platform as the biggest used car online transactional platform. And in this regard, we have bring the most critical part, which is the transactional part to this whole loop. For the TTP, in terms of the transactional volume in the C2B model, it is already the biggest in China. And under 2020, when the home market was not so good, but TTP is, on contradictory, is growing its business. Our next step would be join hands together with Ping An Bank and Ping An P&C. We want to bring chemical reactions together with [Technical Issues] and we would help to see to sell cost better and also help [Technical Issues] to deal better inventory. And in this way we can create more value. To add on what Mr. Shao said, we also narrowed its loss last year, despite actually a declining used car market.

And they will have a minor impact on our bottom line and the contribution to our top line are definitely a positive. And also, I think, all used car online platforms has seen a declining sales volume and revenue last year in China, except for TTP. So if we are not misunderstood, not, sort of, a misunderstanding then, I think, they are already the largest online transaction platform in Chinese used car market last year. Thank you.

0efc0f9057f7555f2d73711304cdb871,"Can we just start with the strength of PowerA? Obviously up 100%. Can you just talk about, is that really just driven from the new consoles, and then maybe, can you break down the growth between North America and EMEA, and how is the EMEA integration going?","PowerA growth is driven by multiple factors. There is the overall growth in gaming and that's been accelerated by the introduction of new consoles released last year from Microsoft and Sony. So, that's part of it. The second part of it is just supply availability, chip availability. PowerA has done a great job managing their supply chain, so we have decent product availability and are able to deliver to our customers when some of our competitors, and including first-tier suppliers such as Sony and Microsoft, can't deliver to all of the demand. And rather, the third primary reason, the team in PowerA has done a great job servicing customers and taking share and increasing their lead. So for all those multiple reasons we saw tremendous growth of slightly over 100% during the quarter. The integration of PowerA is going well. We are in the midst of it right now. The plan is to transition from the services agreement with the seller by the end of the third quarter and be completely on our systems, and then we could get exclusively focused on further growth.",intermediate

How many of those -- is there a way to parse out, how many of those sales are increases in the installed base and original orders versus you've already installed the Auryon device, two, three quarters ago, you've gotten through the initial orders and now you're starting to see the sites increase the revenue -- increase procedure per site.","So, you hit the nail on the head, Matt. We're measuring all of those effects. So, exactly what you asked is a way we're measuring this. Again, this is really a start-up business within a mature operating company. We wanted to be really careful as we took on this marketplace. Our initial moves as you know is supply -- getting our supply chain robust, make sure we get the quality we need on our hardware, first, the capital; and second, on our disposable catheters. So right now, Matt, we're doing everything you said. Every time we place a new laser -- and now we have a good trend, we know how long it takes for users to get confident, comfortable with the device. We can expect the catheter usage to increase on a monthly basis. So we're measuring the metrics you gave us, plus about half of dozen more. As we get this business off the ground, we're really pleased with how the business has started, we've got really great people in the field supporting our users. But, Matt, the metrics you mentioned and a bunch of more, we're going to measure diligently and we'll report back to you, kind of where you'd like to see over time as we expect this to be a growth driver for a long time for us.",intermediate

Any reason to believe that it would resume in the fourth quarter or I mean, do you have any color or thoughts on how to think about -- I mean, I assume that will be a zero going forward until notified otherwise. But is there any color maybe you can give on that?","I can't -- we can't give you any color other than what Ciner has announced and just generally speaking, they've announced that they're suspending it until the market improves. I will tell you this, I think you need to be prepared for a some extended period, multiple quarters for sure of continued tough sledding in the soda ash business. I will say that there are definitely green shoots coming out, if you look globally, especially global demand is starting to pick up. Flat glass and container glass is strong here in the U.S., but I think it's going to take a little while for that market to come back.

So David, we don't normally give guidance as a number, but what we do is, we give the building blocks. So if you take the building blocks of how to build the income statement that Jay spoke to and that's in our press release around the top-line growth, the margin structure and the SG&A, and then, obviously, interest expense, you're going to, obviously, come up with a net income number. Depreciation and amortization will be roughly $45-ish million next year. You can add that back. That's obviously a noncash item. But then the cash item that hits cash flow, it's $65 million to $75 million of CAPEX next year. And roughly $35 million of that is maintenance CAPEX, and the rest is the investments that we're making in the business as part of -- that's obviously generating those productivity gains.",intermediate

But just wondering if you have any line of sight into optimizing capacity and cost and expenses that could potentially benefit the bottom line maybe in 3Q or 4Q?","So we're obviously paying pretty close attention to the level of investment that we have. Obviously, the testing demand is declining. So you could imagine that we're starting to scale back some of our operations. However, it is remaining fairly robust. So there's not a significant amount of cuts that we could do to bring those costs in line, but it is absolutely something that we'll continue to manage appropriately. I don't know, Jon, if you had any specifics there. No, that's right. It's -- no, that's exactly right. We're trying to manage it. Most of the cost, quite honestly, is on the staff side. It's not on the equipment, and some of it is on the supply side on the reagent side.

Good content and great differentiation. The problem is, those land-based vehicles, you got to build an awful lot of them before you get the same content that we get out of a single aisle aircraft. So, it doesn't really offset what's happening with the single aisle aircraft segment. We've also been picking up content in business jets, nice business. But again, those aircraft are much smaller and they don't build as many of them. So, we're still very much wed to both Boeing and Airbus' supply chain.

And are you thinking about kind of just organic reinvestment or any kind of return of capital dividend policy reworks, etc.?","Yes. So I'll let Bryan take a swing and get his voice ready. But we look at earnings growth and dividend policy is both part of our total shareholder proposition. The way we're thinking about your reference to the exit of the midstream business and proceeds there, we've said repeatedly, our first preference is to reinvest in our business and grow our company. And so that's first preference. We're committed to growing the dividend as well. but that's probably the primary focus area. Bryan, do you want to add anything to that?

Yes, absolutely. Good morning Constantine, you mentioned the exit from Enable, and that's important because it certainly improves our business mix as a company we'll be a pure play electric utility, that will help our credit metrics have the best, we'll call excellent business mix. And as you're aware, that's going to allow us to have even more headroom under our credit metrics. So you put that aside and what we focus on that utility is outstanding customer service. And as you see here in 2021, we've increased our capital plan to deliver on the great investments needed to support customer growth. And that's a trend I think you should expect going into the out years as well. And Sean's discussed our capital investment needs coming out of the IRP. So you look at those in combination, and it's -- this company has set itself up really well with a strong balance sheet, constructive regulatory regimes and a capital plan that really works for our customers.

d8348470ae5f282a1a60fdaca702fefd,"Very good. And my follow-up, I appreciate, Ted, outlining the strategy, the four pivots. Just wondering, in terms of your customer portfolio, you did mention that you're seeing an increased penetration of solid state sensors. Wondering how you think about solid state sensor penetration this year, what customers -- and which end markets are adopting the solid state. And wondering about the nature of some of these multiyear agreements and how you're looking at those multiyear agreements and project pipelines progressing throughout the year?","Sure. So let me first comment on the solid state sensor question. We are seeing solid state sensors being sold into automotive applications. Also, a lot of the robotics and industrial automation applications are using solid state, but they're also using rotational. So we're seeing both types of sensors being sold in those kinds of applications. In the intelligent infrastructure segment, the ceramic view rotational sensors are very popular -- products are very popular because you can mount it on a telephone pole in an intersection, and you've got immediate real-time 3D view of traffic and road conditions and pedestrians and other road users. So we're seeing both of those. As far as -- but we do expect to see a continuing increase in the solid state sensors. They do have a benefit, a couple of lower price point, and are very suitable for a lot of those industrial applications. As far as the multiyear agreements are concerned, you will notice that they were conspicuously asking from the press release, as well as from the prepared remarks. The reason for that is that these are very important metrics that we use to measure the business internally, and we will continue to measure both multiyear agreements, as well as the funnel statistics, the number of aggregate customer projects that we have ongoing. The company was very transparent in the past and providing those details in these calls. However, given the increasingly competitive nature of the industry, we made the decision that we will no longer be reporting those multiyear agreements and active projects in the funnel as we've done in past. We are in the process of defining new metrics that we will be able to share with you that will give you a more accurate leading indicator of future revenue growth, and we'll start doing that next quarter.",intermediate

So just if you could touch upon the cash flows for a second and you talked about there were some extraneous items in there because of LSC bankruptcy settlement and also seasonally the cash flows are supposed to be negative in the first quarter. Could you isolate the incentive comp and the LSC impact on cash flows?","Yeah, Raj. So the LSC multi-employer pension plan payments were pretty small in the first quarter. I think around $1 million or so. The two settlements that we talked about, while one of them happened in the first quarter, the payment was actually made in the second quarter. And then, on the second settlement, that payment will also be made in the second quarter. Frankly, the biggest impact on the first quarter cash flow on a year-over-year basis and we were roughly flat, I think down a couple of million dollars in free cash, but the big delta from year-over-year was really driven by the increased incentive comp payments, including annual bonus payments and 401(k).

We're expecting segment growth in industrial and comms and enterprise going from Q4 to Q1. And the decrease in mobile IoT consumer that is just kind of our normal seasonality. And it's even less seasonality than we've seen in past years. I was just going to add one thing to that. Sorry, our largest customer, as I mentioned in my discussion was about 48% of our sales in Q4.

Actually, we talked about regulation before, the spend to your guide and actually this very, very seldom case, which were actually like the achievable content or titles, most time is simply delayed because of longer processing time.

And in terms of what that means for activity for your different assets?","Thank you, Alvaro. I think -- I mean, what we have seen so far is since we open Alto Noa is itself were better that we expected. Traffic was reduced. So, if you measure the traffic was 66% reduction compared to the previous year for the same period of time. But sales were down only 14% compared to last year. And if we see the same-store sales it's 1% up. So that gave us some courage that there is people willing to buy in our shopping centers and all those that go through the Shopping center are less doing tourism and more fully dedicated to go and buy. So we expect that we're going to see that trend, and we hope that we're going to see that trend.

Regarding the opening our centers, as we mentioned, Mendoza and Salta are opened. We expect also -- yesterday was issued a new decree from the province of Santa Fe. So we are expecting to get permission very, very soon to open both our Santa Fe shopping center and Rosario shopping center. And we are working with all the other municipalities and cities to see -- to reopen our shopping centers with very strict protocols of health and measures of -- to avoid any kind of problem in our shopping centers.

Regarding the rest of the business, I mean, as we said, offices are not affected at all. Construction, we expect to do it sooner than we thought a few weeks ago. And regarding hotels, everything seems that they will reopen the borders by September. And as of today, that is the decree. But they might change that. Talking with the municipalities, I mean, some provinces are opening activities regarding tourism. We'll have on July, the -- for us, the winter break. And they are thinking that may allow hotels to do some things during holidays, not with international travelers, but yes, with local. So this is just comments from The Street, but we expect that we're going to see -- what happened in the world, the people was locked for a long period of time.

And then we have seen competitors follow, not all of them, but a vast majority of them, which is a good sign. As far as looking at, we hate to get too far and project out into 2020. But I would say probably the same thing we said at the end of 2019, which is where things are today, where we leave -- we will likely leave 2019 with a nice backlog, tight labor markets, relatively good and positive new construction demand and then the growing reroofing.

So the only things that I can tell you are things that are public. I mean, there's nothing else that I know. But Interactive Brokers announced. And this is also the Bloomberg article that announced our letter and everything. So they announced that, about $88 million of losses. We had some small losses. I'm sure there were lots of small losses scattered throughout the industry. The estimate of the aggregate losses, and it's hard to know because it moved so quickly, both up and down. I mean in a bizarre way, you never reacted at all to the situation. By the end of the day, everyone was positive. We don't run our business that way. We react immediately. And so does everyone else. But the estimates of the losses could be anywhere from $150 million to $1 billion, but no one knows exactly sort of when people were liquidated or what happened. They just take the size of the moves times the open interest. So there could be people out there who have significant losses. I just don't know.

The other thing we know is a very large Singaporean energy business effectively filed for bankruptcy, very large, very well-respected name, rumored to have very significant losses overall.

832d068eada2883950843945c00a1909,"Okay. And then when you look at maybe the synergy projects or the efficiency and integration projects you have around Morbark and the other two, have you quantified kind of a number around what you hope to achieve from those? Or maybe how much -- how many like incremental basis points of margin leverage you might get from those? Just trying to get a feel for where you are at in the integration process and maybe what the potential incremental benefit might be this year or next year.","Yes. Again, we certainly have internally quantified it and internally have targets and goals. We don't usually give much of that publicly. Though we had said even like in Morbark case, their actually operating profit margins were higher than our average operating profit margin. So I mean, like I said, even doing nothing, we thought they should help improve our overall margins. And with the synergies, we also said things like millions of dollars of synergies just in supply like in procurement. And we believe -- and we're pleased that pretty well the synergies on all of this, we're achieving them, but not at the level we anticipated. The purchasing one -- the procurement ones for Morbark, for instance. I mean, two, we had to work down some of their old inventory that was at the higher prices. And secondly, up until now, we hadn't really -- they haven't been producing at the same level. So we haven't been buying as much. So we were getting the synergies that we identified, but not at the full level. We think by the second half of this year, we'll start getting it more at the full level. So we got them integrated into our operating system, our ERP system. We've -- like I say, we're putting them on our benefit structure and other things like this. So I mean we've achieved most of the other synergies we have. Probably the one -- the procurement one, just not at the same level yet. The only area we were going to do more, Morbark is very North American focused.

And we -- through our network, we were going to try to take them a little more internationally. That one, we're -- certainly have not achieved the full level we wanted there just because we're still not allowing anybody to travel internationally so -- across the ocean. So I mean, that one's taking been a little bit slower in developing. But by and large, the synergies are. We also -- and like in Dutch Power, I mean, good -- I mean, we announced in the fourth quarter, a plant consolidation from three plants to two, which will have a very good payback. We've already -- even the one plant, we're proposing to close. We've actually already sold it and actually closed on the sale here in the second quarter of this year already. And so I mean, that whole plant consolidation has about a one-year payback, I mean, let alone improving our overall margins for there. So yes, we believe that when all this is done, we should definitely see overall margin improvement for Alamo Group, even though we have not sort of detailed each unit and each opportunity. But we're pleased that they are occurring. And we're -- like I said, we haven't achieved the dollars we wanted to at this point due to COVID, but we believe we'll still achieve all the synergies we anticipated.",intermediate

e444577751071ca1463f100eaa1902c8,"Yes. And then maybe expanding on that, could you talk about what SmartAudio is running as a percentage of Multiplatform sales and maybe where you see that going over the next year or 2?","Well, we haven't given out the number, but obviously, we think that is going to continue to increase. We've built out the whole SmartAudio platform so that our broadcast radio can be bought and sold like digital can be built around the cohorts. And with the Triton marketplace, which we announced, which we're going to launch in January of next year, we're talking about the first truly integrated audio marketplace in which you will be able to buy one set of audiences cohorts on an integrated basis across podcasting, digital radio, into broadcast radio using SmartAudio. And I think that gives us -- not only us, but I think the audio industry, a great new tool to bring money broadly into this business. And when you look at the kind of reach radio has, every advertiser today has got a problem. They need reach. Digital doesn't reach the numbers that radio does. TV is declining, and certainly doesn't reach what radio does. And people at least have to be able to see or hear your commercial for it to have an impact. So radio winds up, I think, in this pretty good position of being this reach enhancer for everyone. Well, by using SmartAudio, we're able to put it into a language and a technology that they're comfortable with and looking for us to do. So I think as an overall percentage of our advertising on broadcast radio, we look for SmartAudio to be continuing to climb.

And by the way, Steve, and if you think about it, if you look at the significant progress we continue to make on the Multiplatform line and what Bob just touched upon, which includes SmartAudio, and we've talked about as people growing past but getting back to '19 levels, and we've talked about as a total company, and we commonly get the question, do you want to get back there on the Multiplatform line and your confidence in getting back on the Multiplatform line. Remember what Bob just articulated, our capabilities of SmartAudio in the Multiplatform line, that too enables us to tap into the digital TAM, the $160 billion plus $170 billion digital TAM. It's not just our digital line that could tap into it, but it's also our Multiplatform line.",intermediate

bdd94826db93dfa1ab49eda3973050b7,"Okay, got it. And then maybe just an update on the Food and Beverage strategy? Specifically the OHM deal not going through. Can you just remind us how you're thinking about that? What's some of the options are? I think the release had talked about maybe exploring some alternative options with them. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about that? And then related, do you think on the back of COVID, there will be structural changes in how consumers shop Food and Beverage or interact with restaurants in the terminals? Are you rethinking at all types of model including beverage that can work and may be play to your strength?","Hey Seth, this is Roger. I think from our perspective, Food and Beverage is still something that we're still very, very excited in, and are aggressively looking at as part of our long-term growth. I think you hit probably one of the greatest challenges that we're looking at is what does COVID-19 mean to the overall Food and Beverage portfolio on an airport, particularly as it relates to sit-down -- sit-down restaurants, queuing and other aspects. So -- and we've been having conversations with many airport and landlords as well too in that regard to understand what their thoughts are as airports long-term start to look at the evolution of what COVID-19 means to their overall programs. We continue to look at grab and go as unique opportunities. We are continuing to look at cafes and quick-serve as things that we could add and tap onto our retail contracts, very, very quickly. And at some point in time as things evolve a little bit more we will continue to look at M&A as part of our long-term strategy.",intermediate

Is there anything that you mentioned more second half drop-off in IYR, but anything else seasonally quarter-over-quarter through the years to call maybe size just, kind of, steady state sequential growth?","Yes. I think the way to think about it is, kind of, what we said during the script itself. You're spot on that the analytics would grow pretty strong and that toward the second half of the year IYR starts to decline. I think we made the comment that if you looked at total company revenues, you would see them approaching the 20% growth rate target that we had set for analytics.",intermediate

Yeah. So remember this is -- this whole business is a little spotty. It's U.S. based. We continue to have patients enrolling in Australia. We have announced that, we when we think of this trial, it's a North American Australia sites trial. So that includes Canada.

And as you can imagine, we are exploring other places where we might be able to open sites. So by all means we are exploring and spending a significant amount of both human, of human capital on trying to, shall we say find a solution to this problem that is independent of the timing associated with the FDA. I will say that we did have an investigator meeting at the AAIC here. And I can tell you that the enthusiasm of the clinical teams for this trial are quite high for a lot of the reasons we always talk about when we showcase the trial, it is unique in design.

They like the idea that it's a separate trial for MCI and mild AD that it's short and that it is that that we actually provide patients with an additional 12 months of drug whether they're in the active or placebo arm. So the clinical teams like it, they're excited. They too are frustrated by those in the U.S. by the clinical hold, but we are not standing still ringing our hands, waiting for the FDA.

We are being as innovative as we -- as you can imagine, we would be. But by the same token, where we have learned not to make predictions until we have our bird in the hand. So you can be assured, we're working hard and as things loosen up or move forward, we will let you know.",intermediate

Maybe wanted to talk a little bit about the core business in the U.S., so a somewhat measurable deceleration in terms of the year-over-year growth from the second quarter. But I don't -- I'm not sure if there is some other -- some year-over-year things that you guys are lapping or anything that might, explain that.","Hi Dillard. Thank you for the question. I think all-in-all, we do see quite interesting increase of the quartz penetration in the U.S. And we are quite encouraged by the continuous penetration of this category in the U.S. in which we are continue to -- with our efforts to have a bit of go-to-market platform, we continue to invest behind our sales team and actually all the initiatives that we put in our Global Growth Acceleration Plan, are implants regarding the U.S. I think all that has been kind of -- I mean effected itself in this quarter increase in -- sorry, growth in our revenue with 4.6% in our core business",intermediate
2b46adb1674a082c936ac31fed5035ce,"Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. You guys mentioned, I think, for Q2 we should expect organic growth in aviation. How should we think about growth in marine and land? I know Ira, I believe you said gross profit improvement year over year in marine, I assume that's mainly coming from price, not necessarily volume. How should we think about marine and land, organic growth, if you will?","So, within marine, we've got 2020. There has been a lot of wait and see on that. The forward curve isn't really showing very much. But there have been a couple of select deals, but if you look at -- and I've said this before -- aviation being a manifestation for the entire company in terms of a combination of asset light, select physical inventory distribution and technology. That applied to both marine and land. So, we'll have a selective approach to organic growth. We've got tremendous capabilities.

We are leveraging more of the capabilities within the company that cut across all of the segments. We'll continue to grow organically. We'll penetrate markets selectively, both on the asset-light side, which we've done in marine and aviation, but selectively entered the physical side of equation, try to add more services where we can, utilizing technology. Within land, as I've mentioned, I think last quarter, we are going to use the global platform that we have within marine and aviation to selectively grow our land business.

Certainly, the US is an area of interest where we've got a foothold within Europe. So, there are acquisitions within the land space. We have fairly small market share. That's a fairly rich place for us to continue to grow our C&I business. Within connect, we believe we've got good growth within our gas and power and sustainability business, blending those together on a go to market within our commercial and industrial users makes a lot of sense.

I made reference to that last quarter. It's a combination of leveraging the corporation's innate capabilities and applying that across the entire business using our global platform to logically extend into those different activities and then selectively looking at acquisitions.

So, marine we feel good about in terms of getting some growth there. Certainly with 2020, we are well-prepared to support our loyal clients and then land has been a rough road, but we feel like we are getting a solid team together and while technology is slow to come, we are focused very much on the customer experience and being able to overcome some of the challenges in terms of putting together complex systems.

So, we feel like we've got a much better growth curve and momentum and the land engine is starting to come together. It's palpable in terms of a hell of a lot more engagement within the team, both on diesel, gas, and power and sustainable. So, that feels good. We're feeling very positive about that. And then marine team as well is extremely engaged. So, it feels like all of the businesses are coming together and the balance sheet looks good. We're ready to roll. It's never simple, but we feel like we're in better condition now than ever before.",intermediate
31ba2f482205d80f860e7c036336a743,"OK. And then, just my last question is one of the key differentiation pieces in our view is certainly the creative side of the business with Truly. Can you just talk about the drivers of increased use of Truly for video ads? And then just help us understand what that brings to the rest of the model, right? I understood more engagement is just good, but kind of put that help us understand that as we relate this back to excel.","Thank you. I will take it, Sagi. So I think that -- when we are talking about creative, we have to understand that there is a few elements to the importance of the creative. First of all, as we indicated to increase the engagement. But apart from that is to increase the efficiency when you are connecting between creative and data. And this is something that we were able to grow a lot the efficiency and the engagement in the last year and a half or close to two years since we basically started that because Truly, it's basically after we acquired, and Unruly, we released this product. And it did a very good job, and we see the growth about that. And I think that advertisers like it because it's basically serving two of their goals. First of all is to reach the right audience with the right message. And the second one is to basically increase the engagement with that. So we see that as a catalyst also to sell when we are offering these capabilities to advertisers when compared to other companies that are less is doing that. I think that we are gaining more attention. We are getting more budget and we are getting more response from advertisers. And it's a tool that we really enjoy using in the market, and it's bringing a lot of great results to us and, of course, to our clients that are using them.",intermediate
96e7c416a898fa62f8990efc32a8571d,I wanted to ask also another question about the TX200 program. I guess how do you think about dosing in the TX200 program? And do you expect CAR-TREG cells to expand? I really just am trying to get out like what's the expectation for efficacy in low dose cohorts in the Solid Organ Transplant study.,"So we never guide to -- the first dose of any study is always a balance between prudence and hoping that piece of that patient will get some benefit, but until you do the study, you don't know. Jason, TREG expansion or what happens to TREG when it's given?

Yes. Thanks, Sandy. We definitely expect the TREG to expand in the patient upon encounter with the cognate ligands for the CAR receptor that we are engineering the TREG with. So, we certainly anticipate and that by design, that when the TREG get to the tissue, where the antigen is expressed, they will be activated through their core receptor. And that will trigger them to proliferate and to acquire their immuno regulatory and suppressive properties. So that's what we expect to see. And that's what we've seen in the preclinical data that we've shown and the preclinical data that our partner Mabe Levin [Phonetic] are active in partner Mabe Levin [Phonetic] to the public. So we definitely expect expansion.

And if I may add something to what Jason has summarized. In terms of initiating the study this year, we do intend to initiate the study. But Similar to other genetically engineered cell therapy approaches, patients will undergo a leukapheresis procedure from which the TREG cells will be isolated and engineered and preserved. And the HLA to negative patient will subsequently undergo transplantation surgery. And then following a recovery period will receive the personalized TX200 drug candidate and so as a result of this detailed process, we expect that dosing of patients will occur several months after their enrollment. And as such dosing may be this year or next year. We're not committing to dosing his year but certainly to initiating the clinical trial this year.",intermediate

952fc4d67e5b20d35b98a05ec3a96886,"So how do you incentivize your agents to push your Title and Escrow and mortgage versus alternatives given kind of rest rules? And then secondly, there's obviously been numerous technical factors that have weighed on the stock. As you get past the lockup, the earnings lag out, I mean, the stock cannot get more support. I mean, are you willing to consider a buyback or kind of more aggressive opex reductions? And maybe kind of just give us your perspective there.","Yes. So I'll answer the first question. I'll let Kristen answer the second. Yes. So of course, there are rest of rules that we follow and the entire industry follows, where you can't economically incentivize an agent for referring title and mortgage to their clients or any other product or service that's required at the transaction complete. And so we follow that. And so we have to be able to compete by having the best title officer, the best loan officers. You go in the good old-fashioned way with the best service. And what's unique about what we our building is the platform is going to integrate the actual title and mortgage solutions through the agent workflow. It will be embedded in the workflow and integrated into the workflow, making it easier for the agent and their clients to complete the transaction. And so good old-fashioned, again, a better service on the human side but also on the software side. And in terms of your second question, Jason, we -- look, we remain very confident in our strategy here. So what we are focused on, first and foremost, is execution. Even -- we see some of the technical challenges that you're pointing to. And of course, we'll be open to evaluating different options there.

And then maybe just any kind of core outlook that you could provide for the rest of calendar '21. And then if you care to kind of throw down the [Indecipherable] on political in '22 versus '20 on a calendar basis?,"All right. Well, taking them in order, look, we gave guide on the fourth quarter for plus 40 for the Local Media segment. Look, professional services continues to show strength and growth. I think you've heard Jason explain it earlier, it's now a full 25% of our local core advertising business. And an auto makes up about 20%. And we saw very modest growth for auto in Q3 at like plus 3% look, as soon as these chips and rubber and foam shortages all right themselves and sort themselves out, I would say, for the rest of the calendar year, as that recovers, so will the advertising piece behind auto. But we do continue to see strength in professional and home, and we don't look for those to abate. For political, I'm very excited about our '22 cycle, even against our amazing '20 cycle. We have 13 governors races and 13 Senate seats. And you've heard me say this before, even though we had a great presidential run in '20, the reality is a larger percentage of our political revenues come from those hotly contested governor and senate races. And we're going to have a full slate of those across our footprint. So I think what you'll see will be record setting.",intermediate
3459b9b0f23ebc1e3bfaf9be1dd0ff2c,"No, I think the point about not having to ship 50% no matter what is very clear, I guess, it gives you a lot of flexibility. So that part helps for sure. And then going to the supply chain services, I'm sorry, the specialty computing business, the $90 million to $100 million from the acquisitions in fiscal '20 you're roughly forecasting. What's the linearity of that? Is that back-end loaded or fairly even? And do the acquired businesses have similar seasonality to Penguin in the coming years or just in general?","Yeah. We don't think that the seasonality is quite the same because Penguin has a significant federal component which has this particular seasonality. However, Penguin is a big part of that specialty compute segment for us. And so we will see that variation, a weaker Q2 again because that's when the federal business is at its low point. And then a stronger Q4 are -- the business we acquired from Artesyn does have some decent size military component as well. So that tends to have a slightly higher Q4, it's not as much of a peak. So we would see somewhat similar behavior, just a little bit more modulated compared to Penguin, which has somewhat more extreme seasonality.",intermediate
375b050c8181e617302507d1bf8c2614,"Last one for me, I've asked this previously, but a little more directly, maybe your net cash position almost in net cash at this point. Nice debt repayment, but from the capital allocation standpoint, your stock valuation relative to earnings is lagged to peers for years. I guess, you guys are focused on acquisitions, which have come out a fairly sizable premium to MEI's valuation. Have you reconsidered a meaningful share buyback program versus more focus on acquisitions.","A very appropriate question. That is something that we are considering. We're now going to -- we're up [Phonetic] over $200 million in cash. Not likely to pay down much more debt, it is very inexpensive debt. There is some debt in Europe, we may repay. So now, but let me back up. We thought it was very, very important after doing the Grakon acquisition that we proved to the Street that Methode has a discipline to achieve the synergies and more importantly pay down debt. And we've accomplished that. And for the last, since the Grakon acquisition that was priority one. Now, where we're sitting today, we're ahead of where we thought we would be, largely because our teams did a very good job of taking cost out of the factories and dealing with tariffs and so on.

So now we will turn our attention to where do we put that cash to use. Do we do a stock buyback? That is certainly on our list. I won't give you a priority on it, but it is certainly something that we are considering. Having said that, we will -- we always look at acquisitions. Grakon was I think at first, there were some concern about it, but it clearly has put us in good stead in the commercial vehicle market and the EV market. And some of the EV wins we had were on what will be commercial trucks. And particularly, when you get into BDUs and PDUs. So I'm not going to say that we're not going to do an acquisition. So I'm not going to give you the order, but I can tell you the stock buyback is something that we would certainly consider.",intermediate

You've gotten your balance sheet on more solid footing than last year. How are you thinking about the opportunities strategically for the company with respect to M&A? Or other strategic opportunities for Core Lab in a market that's now positioned for growth rather than contraction?","Sure. I'd say first of all our attention is always drawn toward our internal pipeline for technology development. It is a foundation for where we go. We've got a number of very intriguing technologies some including nuclear physics sort of revolutionary approach to how we'll address Core analysis in the future.

And then, on our product side a number of innovations both on diagnostics and energetic systems. So first our attention goes to growth opportunities we have and investment opportunities we have there. We're always looking and always listening to opportunities on the M&A side. I can say that we go through a rather rigorous evaluation of the technical and financial consequences of M&A, as we look at things we -- as you mentioned we now have called the balance sheet flexibility to act on those things.

The one thing I would say in terms of M&A as we look over the landscape of opportunities that are out there. If Core Lab acts on an M&A opportunity, it'll be something that you look at and go, well, that makes sense that sticks close to Core Lab's wheelhouse of things we know.

Just wondering, should we think about the enlarged stock repurchase program and perhaps further stock repurchase program as a more occurring practice down the road? And the second question is on the deferred revenue. Deferred revenue balance was very strong this quarter and I was wondering if the management could give some color on this growth and whether it's due to the mix change between PC and mobile game.","Okay. Alex, for your first question, our treasury policy is always very prudent. We are one of the very, very few tech companies globally that pays a regular dividend. In fact, we've been paying a regular dividend since 2013 and we will continue to do so, returning value to our shareholders, especially long-term shareholders who has been supporting us in the journey of the growth over the last two decades. The stock buyback program is also a regular exercise for a couple of years. And when the situation requires and then within our ability, we can go back to the Board, just like this time, seeking for the authorization of enhanced dollar amount for the overall stock buyback. So that is on the treasury cash management aspect. For your deferred revenue, we don't further break down exactly on the composition, but I think you are right. In Q1, if I remember correctly, it is probably another record quarter for both recognized revenue as well as deferred revenue. And again, largely, it's underpinned by the gross billings and the growth of both PC lines as well as mobile lines of games, largely consistent with what you are seeing in the year-over-year growth for the recognized revenue. Youdao also contributed to a certain extent, of course, but then you can refer to Youdao's public filing for the deferred revenue incremental portion.",intermediate

So I was wondering if you could perhaps try to talk about or define how many years behind do you think the competition is in terms of their fulfillment ability in Brazil, perhaps focusing on new entrants like Shopee. Second, you talked about increasing sales of more sophisticated point-of-sale payment devices. And I was trying to understand when do you think the larger merchants that you're selling these two will begin to start contributing to acceleration in off-platform TPV growth?","Look, on the competitive front, I think we always say the market has been competitive. It's a huge opportunity. It will continue to be competitive. And rather than looking at how many years of a head start do we have, it's how can we move consistently faster and accelerate our own pace of rollout of our network to try to continue to drive up same and next-day delivery, continue to expand free shipping. So I think the playbook so far, we've been very successful, and we just need to make sure that we don't get complacent, and we continue to do everything in our power to drive down cost, return a part of that improved cost back to consumers in the form of more free shipping and continue to roll out the network efficiently so that we can get faster and faster. And I think it's an ongoing race, and we don't want to measure how far ahead we are because that could breed complacency. Craig, with regards to our MPOS business, we are already seeing the effects of moving up market, mostly in Argentina, and it's starting to happen in Brazil, too.

Does it become incremental to EBITDA as we head into the first half of the year? Or is it more catch up and then maybe a little bit more incremental in the second half of the year?","Yeah. I actually think the pricing overall for the year, the pricing improvement in dollars will more than offset those inflationary costs, energy, raw materials, logistics, etc. As you can see from the trajectory, essentially half of the price increase for the entire year occurred in the fourth quarter.

It has to do with the aging of the bladder. That certainly is one of the main factors, maybe with the stretch receptors. However, the true origin is not known. Men with BPH have an additional extra factor which women don't have, because men have a prostate. So the urethra is longer, sorry to go into anatomy now, and their bladder outlet is different from that in women. Women have a very short urethra while the men have the prostate. And if there is an enlargement or an obstruction of the outlet, basically, the overactive bladder sort of works against this outlet obstruction. And so it is actually pathophysiologically slightly different from the OAB, the general OAB, particularly in women. That's why the FDA agreed to a separate development program for OAB in men with BPH. There is no approved therapy. There are occasional published studies. They exist, but there's really no good development program to fully characterize the efficacy and safety of an OAB medication, including the beta-3 agonist in men with BPH and OAB. And Eric, if I could just build on the question related to the label, clearly, it's a differentiated label with vibegron, if we're successful with achieving that indication. And I think from a payer receptivity perspective, it's really positive, given the fact that it has the ability to treat overactive bladder and overactive bladder in men with BPH.

Can you talk about some of the puts and takes in terms of how you're thinking about the holiday season this year versus last year?,"Sure. Thanks for the follow-up question. As we look at the holiday season, there are certainly some challenges that we're mindful of. The macro environment remains uncertain, and we're seeing continued inflationary pressures. That said, we feel good about our position heading into the holidays. We've got a strong product lineup, including some exciting new launches. Our inventory is in good shape, and we've been pleased with the initial response to our holiday marketing campaigns. We're also continuing to invest in our digital capabilities, which we believe will be especially important this holiday season. So while we're certainly cognizant of the headwinds, we feel we're well-positioned for the holiday period.",intermediate

Did you incur any extra challenges in the last 12 months related to this closing and declining the employee base?","We made some provisions also to that throughout the year, and now we are going to expand it. So the idea is to spend the money on a cash basis to -- on the following month, but most of it will be expanded now in the fourth quarter. The reason for that is that you remember that Octavio, our CEO, in the end of the first quarter, announced that we would reduce 400 branches. And now we are increasing this number.

How many sites have been open? And how many additional sites will be opened through the remainder of this year?","Yes. So we've decided we're not actually going to be giving specific updates on accrual and sites as the study goes forward, but I can tell you that it's been a robust pickup. We've got sites in the U.S. and Australia already enrolling. We're about to open sites in a number of different European countries and in Canada. The interest is high. There are not very many other studies that are currently enrolling in that setting. And I think it's also really helping us that not only do we have the sites and the investigators on our Phase III trial that are engaged but through the collaboration that we now have in place with the National Cancer Institute, there are many sites. I mean I think they've got over 100 sites in that network now in the U.S. that are also getting enthusiastic around the program.

A lot of times we've had customers that were on contract that have come off but they're still having very consistent volumes with them. So even though they maybe typically spot today, they're still from historical contractual relationships and management. So we don't really split it up in terms of giving out the difference between spot and contract. And also when we say spot, I think a lot of times people think of spot just being one kind of individual sale. A lot of our spot transactions today, where we may be supporting a customer for three to six months while they have a certain plan for delivering sand to that market.

We think we are adequately offset with new home SKU growth, we expect new homes SKU growth to continue, both in breadth and depth, particularly the supply chain challenges loosen and ease. We think that's the time where SKU growth could really increase and do that. So there is some short-term headwind, but we think the long-term tailwind, being in home, being more associated with home where shoppers purchase more frequently, bigger order size, or just better customers is worth.

Do you think because of the depression in cryptos, some chip capacity may have been released and that may be easing out the chip shortage that automotive industry is facing. Are you seeing something to that effect?","I'm not good enough to answer your question there, Trip. I'm not a big crypto fan. Hate to say that. You know, they got you. So I don't follow that very closely. I know it's very depressed at this point. And I don't know the relationship with that. I'm sure there are some with the chip shortages issue. So sorry, I can't answer that question.",fully_evasive

And if possible, a more longer-term value.","Yes. I heard you're asking for depreciation dollars per ounce, I -- we're using the units of production method based on ounces produced. I don't have, unfortunately, a number in my head that I can share with you but what we should expect, as we're depreciating based on ounces -- on a per ounce basis, it of course is the depreciation tracking, of course, the production output, as well as the life of mine, right. So that will be in sync which with the evolution of -- of income to all the life of mine.

Yeah, I'm sorry I can't give you a number, right now because I don't -- I don't have it in front of me.",fully_evasive
6ebdcbb90cd1ebb42a9aa2ad07e28b32,So I think I just heard you say when you went to Tom's question that Jacksonville is almost full. I guess how contributory was it top line-wise to the business?,"Yeah, that's a good question, Darren. I think the challenge with a same-store metric like this for an online retailer is that for us, you're always focusing on delivery speed, and so we're constantly optimizing for shipping times and transportation costs. So if you're looking at it on a same-store basis, it's kind of difficult to quantify.",fully_evasive

6180f1dbe0e2b7e29d9dd3468eae56b3,"First of all is, can management talk a little bit about your view on the 2022 GMV growth? And the second is, can the management help to sort of break down the rough mix of Asia and new markets in terms of EBITDA loss this quarter?","We don't give guidance on GMV, but we did give guidance on GAAP revenue for e-commerce. We believe that it reflects our view about the potential growth rate. And I also mentioned that in terms of the take rate increase, there will be -- while we will continue to increase take rate, the pace will be moderated and well measured.  We don't also do the -- give the breakdown in terms of the EBITDA, but we have given the order number for fourth quarter on Brazil and also the EBITDA loss previous allocation per order in Brazil. So I think you can roughly do the math.",fully_evasive
c67a56802eae56d0ba4306711b5d1e97,Does this regulatory decision change your expectation of a clean or differentiated level compared to ESAs?,"At this point in time, we have to go through the AdCom. We have a product with a significant amount of clinical data. Keep in mind, there are pivotal data for the U.S., including over 8,000 patients. We discussed the clinical data at length. We continue to stand behind our data and the strength of the data. Some of the data now has been published. There are five primary manuscripts that have been published, and a number of more that are upcoming. But at this point in time, I don't want to speculate on the nature of the AdCom. We very much look forward to have the opportunity to share the roxadustat data in a public forum.",fully_evasive

Can you just talk about how much of your expenses are sort of more variable, both on the residential side and then on the commercial as well?","Yeah, thanks. The objective we've had, I've been here seven months, and obviously we've been very focused on improving our margins and we'll continue to be focused on that to position this company for profitable growth for a long time. So we've done a lot of targeted actions in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter we took additional targeted actions, and I fully expect as we look forward, given the situation, that we'll continue to take targeted actions to improve our position.

This is extraordinary times, right. And so my job isn't to manage expenses. My job is to create shareholder value. So our goal will be to do what we need to do to manage our place through this, while keeping our team together focused and excited about improving and growing. That's what we'll do.

So I don't -- we will do things, we'll manage ourselves appropriately through this and position ourselves to be quite strong as we come out of it. So I think we're a more nimble company and a company ready to adjust and that will be our focus, so.",fully_evasive

d85e29436563ba1e48df97eaaebf06cc,"OK. The other question was you mentioned the goal was to pay down $150 million in debt. How would you think of allocating that between the revolving credit, the term loan and bonds or I think you actually said reduced net debt, would you just allow cash to accumulate?","Well, as I said during the call, we're working with some financial advisors. So I think that that will all be part of that process evaluating how to apply the cash flows of the business and the timing of when we do that.",fully_evasive
